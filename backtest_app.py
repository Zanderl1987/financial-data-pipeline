r"""
backtest_app.py -- live interactive explorer for the unified evaluation
framework's results. Reads registry + run artifacts, and for signals with a
recognized TradeRule shape, re-runs evaluation.trades.simulate() live as the
user drags threshold sliders -- no new backtest math, everything here
delegates to evaluation/ and generate_eval_report's existing loaders.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-03-interactive-backtest-explorer-design.md.
